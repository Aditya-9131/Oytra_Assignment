2. What was the most frustrating part of the data, and how would you explain deleting 20% of the leads?

Most Frustrating Part

The most frustrating part of the data was that it was very messy and inconsistent.

Some problems I faced were:

Dates were written in many different formats.

Some rows had extra columns or missing values.

Fake or test data was mixed with real user data.

Some emails were invalid (missing “@” or domain).

There was no clear validation rule before exporting the data.

Because the data came from different landing pages, it did not follow one standard structure. This made it harder to clean and required extra checking and validation.

In simple words, the data did not follow basic quality rules, so I had to carefully fix and filter it before using it.

How I Would Explain Deleting 20% of Leads to a Non-Technical Manager

I would explain it like this:

“We did not delete real customers. We removed bad or unusable entries.”

About 20% of the leads were:

Test entries created during development

Fake names like “test” or “asdf”

Invalid email addresses

Incomplete or broken records

Corrupted rows due to formatting issues

If we kept those leads in the CRM:

Sales team would waste time calling fake numbers or invalid contacts.

Email campaigns would bounce and reduce our sender reputation.

Marketing reports would show incorrect conversion rates.

The business might make wrong decisions based on bad data.

So removing those 20% actually improves:

Sales productivity

Marketing accuracy

CRM data quality

Business decision-making

It’s better to have fewer high-quality leads than many low-quality leads.

Keeping bad data only increases confusion and reduces trust in reports.

Final Business Explanation

Deleting 20% of leads was not a loss —
It was a data quality improvement step.

Clean data helps the company grow faster and make smarter decisions.
