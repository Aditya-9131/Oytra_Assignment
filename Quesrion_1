1. Explain in simple words, what logic did you apply?

To clean the messy signup data and create a proper “Golden Record” file, I followed a clear and structured process. My goal was to make the data clean, consistent, and useful for the CRM and sales team.

Step 1: Standardizing the Dates

The signup dates were in different formats because the data came from multiple landing pages. Some dates were written like:

01/02/2024

2-1-24

Jan 2, 2024

Different date formats can cause confusion when sorting or analyzing data.

So I converted all dates into one standard format:

YYYY-MM-DD (for example: 2024-01-02)

This makes:

Reporting easier

Sorting accurate

Data consistent

Step 2: Removing Duplicate Users

Some users signed up more than once. This created duplicate records in the dataset.

To solve this:

I used the email address as a unique identifier because normally one person has one email.

If the same email appeared multiple times, I kept only the most recent signup.

I removed the older entries.

This ensures:

No duplicate entries in CRM

Sales team does not contact the same person twice

Marketing data stays accurate

Step 3: Identifying Low-Quality or Fake Leads

Some records clearly looked like test data or fake entries. For example:

Names like “test” or “dummy”

Emails without “@”

Random text like “asdf”

Missing important information

These records are not real customers.

Instead of deleting them permanently, I:

Flagged them as low-quality

Moved them into a separate file called quarantine.csv

This keeps the final CRM file clean while still keeping a record of removed data.

Step 4: Handling Users with Multiple Plans

Some users signed up for both Plan A and Plan B.

The business rule said:

If a user signed up for both plans,

Keep the most recent signup,

Add a flag called is_multi_plan = True.

So I:

Checked how many different plans each email had.

If a user had more than one plan,

I marked them as is_multi_plan = True

Kept only their most recent signup record.

This keeps important business information instead of losing it during duplicate removal.

Final Result

After applying all these steps:

members_final.csv contains clean, structured, and reliable data.

quarantine.csv contains suspicious or low-quality leads.

The logic ensures the CRM receives:

Clean dates

No duplicates

No fake data

Correct business context

Overall, the goal was not just cleaning data — it was making the data reliable and useful for business decisions.
