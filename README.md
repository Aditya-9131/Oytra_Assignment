# Oytra Assignment

## Assignment Logic
This assignment is designed to demonstrate the application of software engineering principles to complete specific tasks. It focuses on implementing logic that adheres to predefined requirements and best practices.

### Core Components
- **Input Validation:** Checks to ensure all input data is correct and formatted properly.
- **Data Processing:** Uses algorithms and methods to process the input data and derive meaningful results.
- **Output Generation:** Presents the results in a clear and understandable manner, suitable for end-users.

## Explanations
1. **Input Validation:** This ensures that the program only receives valid inputs, minimizing errors.
2. **Data Processing:** After validation, data is manipulated using efficient algorithms to achieve required results.
3. **Output Details:** Results are formatted for clarity, providing users with the necessary information.

## Output Details
- The final output includes various metrics and information generated from the data.
- Each output is formatted to enhance readability and usability for end-users.

## Conclusion
This README serves as a guide to understanding the structure and logic behind the Oytra Assignment. It outlines the processes involved and provides a comprehensive overview of the outputs you can expect from running the program.
